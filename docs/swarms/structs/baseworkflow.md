Explanation:
 
Initially, the `BaseWorkflow` class is a class designed to handle workflows. It contains a list within the task pool to handle various tasks and run methods. In the current structure, there are a few in-built methods such as `add`, `run`, `__sequential_loop`, `__log`, `reset`, `get_task_results`, `remove_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, `save_workflow_state`, `add_objective_to_workflow`, and `load_workflow_state`, each serving a unique purpose.
 
The `add` method functions to add tasks or a list of tasks to the task pool while the `run` method is left as an abstract method for initializing the workflow. Considering the need to run the workflow, `__sequential_loop` is another abstract method. In cases where the user desires to log messages, `__log` can be utilized. For resetting the workflow, there is a `reset` method, complemented by `get_task_results` that returns the results of each task in the workflow. To remove a task from the workflow, `remove_task` can be employed.
 
In cases where an update is required for the tasks in the workflow, `update_task` comes in handy. Deleting a task from the workflow can be achieved using the `delete_task` method. The method saves the workflowâ€™s state to a JSON file, and the user can fix the path where the file resides. For adding objectives to the workflow, `add_objective_to_workflow` can be employed, and there is an abstract method of `load_workflow_state` for loading the workflow state from a JSON file providing the freedom to revert the workflow to a specific state.
 
The class also has a method `__str__` and `__repr__` to represent the text and instantiate an object of the class, respectively. The object can be reset, task results obtained, tasks removed, tasks updated, tasks deleted, or workflow state saved. The structure provides detailed methods for altering the workflow at every level.
