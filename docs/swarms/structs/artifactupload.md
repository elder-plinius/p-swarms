# swarms.structs

## Overview

Swarms is a library that provides tools for managing a distributed system of agents working together to achieve a common goal. The structs module within Swarms provides a set of data structures and classes that are used to represent artifacts, tasks, and other entities within the system. The `ArtifactUpload` class is one such data structure that represents the process of uploading an artifact to an agent's workspace.

## ArtifactUpload

The `ArtifactUpload` class inherits from the `BaseModel` class. It has two attributes: `file` and `relative_path`. The `file` attribute represents the bytes of the file to be uploaded, while the `relative_path` attribute represents the relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace.

### Class Definition

```python
class ArtifactUpload(BaseModel):
    file: bytes = Field(..., description="File to upload")
    relative_path: Optional[str] = Field(
        None,
        description=("Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace"),
        example="python/code/",
    )
```

The `ArtifactUpload` class requires the `file` attribute to be passed as an argument. It is of type `bytes` and represents the file to be uploaded. The `relative_path` attribute is optional and is of type `str`. It represents the relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace. If not provided, it defaults to `None`.

### Functionality and Usage

The `ArtifactUpload` class is used to create an instance of an artifact upload. It can be instantiated with or without a `relative_path`. Here is an example of how the class can be used:

```python
from swarms.structs import ArtifactUpload

# Uploading a file with no relative path
upload_no_path = ArtifactUpload(file=b"example_file_contents")

# Uploading a file with a relative path
upload_with_path = ArtifactUpload(
    file=b"example_file_contents", relative_path="python/code/"
)
```

In the above example, `upload_no_path` is an instance of `ArtifactUpload` with no specified `relative_path`, whereas `upload_with_path` is an instance of `ArtifactUpload` with the `relative_path` set to "python/code/".

### Additional Information

When passing the `file` and `relative_path` parameters to the `ArtifactUpload` class, ensure that the `file` parameter is provided exactly as the file that needs to be uploaded, represented as a `bytes` object. If a `relative_path` is provided, ensure that it is a valid path within the agent's workspace.

# Conclusion

The `ArtifactUpload` class is an essential data structure within the Swarms library that represents the process of uploading an artifact to an agent's workspace. By using this class, users can easily manage and represent artifact uploads within the Swarms distributed system.
