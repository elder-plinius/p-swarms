==================================

### [What is the Agent Feature?](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Agent feature is a powerful component of the Swarms framework that allows developers to create a sequential, conversational interaction with AI language models. It enables developers to build multi-step conversations, generate long-form content, and perform complex tasks using AI. The Agent class provides autonomy to language models, enabling them to generate responses in a structured manner.

### [Key Concepts](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before diving into the practical aspects, let's clarify some key concepts related to the Agent feature:

-   Agent: A Agent is an instance of the Agent class that represents an ongoing interaction with an AI language model. It consists of a series of steps and responses.
-   Stopping Condition: A stopping condition is a criterion that, when met, allows the Agent to stop generating responses. This can be user-defined and can depend on the content of the responses.
-   Loop Interval: The loop interval specifies the time delay between consecutive interactions with the AI model.
-   Retry Mechanism: In case of errors or failures during AI model interactions, the Agent can be configured to make multiple retry attempts with a specified interval.
-   Interactive Mode: Interactive mode allows developers to have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI model, making it suitable for real-time interactions.

## [2. Setting Up Your Development Environment](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you can start using the Swarms Agent module, you need to set up your development environment. First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies, including Swarms itself.

# Install Swarms and required libraries
`pip3 install --upgrade swarms`

## [2. Creating Your First Agent](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's create your first Agent. A Agent represents a chain-like structure that allows you to engage in multi-step conversations with language models. The Agent structure is what gives an LLM autonomy. It's the Mitochondria of an autonomous agent.

# Import necessary modules
```python
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat  # Zephr, Mistral
from swarms.structs import Agent

api_key = ""  # Initialize the language model (LLM)
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key, temperature=0.5, max_tokens=3000
)  # Initialize the Agent object

agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=5)  # Run the agent
out = agent.run("Create an financial analysis on the following metrics")
print(out)
```

### [3. Initializing the Agent Object](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Agent object that will be the backbone of your conversational agent.

```python
# Initialize the Agent object
agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=5,
    stopping_condition=None,  # You can define custom stopping conditions
    loop_interval=1,
    retry_attempts=3,
    retry_interval=1,
    interactive=False,  # Set to True for interactive mode
    dashboard=False,  # Set to True for a dashboard view
    dynamic_temperature=False,  # Enable dynamic temperature handling
)
```

### [3.2 Initializing the Language Model](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initialize the language model (LLM) that your Agent will interact with. In this example, we're using OpenAI's GPT-3 as the LLM.

-   You can also use `Mistral` or `Zephr` or any of other models!

```python
# Initialize the language model (LLM)
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=3000,
)
```

### [3.3 Running Your Agent](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, you're ready to run your Agent and start interacting with the language model.

If you are using a multi modality model, you can pass in the image path as another parameter

```
# Run your Agent
out = agent.run(
    "Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.",
    # "img.jpg" , Image path for multi-modal models
    )

print(out)
```

This code will initiate a conversation with the language model, and you'll receive responses accordingly.

## [4. Advanced Agent Concepts](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
===========================================================================================================================

In this section, we'll explore advanced concepts that can enhance your experience with the Swarms Agent module.

### [4.1 Custom Stopping Conditions](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)

You can define custom stopping conditions for your Agent. For example, you might want the Agent to stop when a specific word is mentioned in the response.

# Custom stopping condition example
```python
def stop_when_repeats(response: str) -> bool:
    return "Stop" in response.lower()
```

# Set the stopping condition in your Agent
```agent.stopping_condition = stop_when_repeats```

### [4.2 Dynamic Temperature Handling](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic temperature handling allows you to adjust the temperature attribute of the language model during the conversation.

# Enable dynamic temperature handling in your Agent
`agent.dynamic_temperature = True`

This feature randomly changes the temperature attribute for each loop, providing a variety of responses.

### [4.3 Providing Feedback on Responses](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can provide feedback on responses generated by the language model using the `provide_feedback` method.

- Provide feedback on a response
`agent.provide_feedback("The response was helpful.")`

This feedback can be valuable for improving the quality of responses.

### [4.4 Retry Mechanism](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of errors or issues during conversation, you can implement a retry mechanism to attempt generating a response again.

# Set the number of retry attempts and interval
```python
agent.retry_attempts = 3
agent.retry_interval = 1  # in seconds
```
### [4.5 Response Filtering](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add response filters to filter out certain words or phrases from the responses.

# Add a response filter
```python
agent.add_response_filter("inappropriate_word")
```
This helps in controlling the content generated by the language model.

### [4.6 Interactive Mode](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactive mode allows you to have a back-and-forth conversation with the language model. When enabled, the Agent will prompt for user input after each response.

# Enable interactive mode
`agent.interactive = True`

This is useful for real-time conversations with the model.
