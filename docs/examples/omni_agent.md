**4. Practical Examples: Letâ€™s Get Our Hands Dirty!**

Letâ€™s embark on an exciting journey with OmniModalAgent:

**i. Basic Interaction**:

```python
from swarms.agents import OmniModalAgent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat

llm = OpenAIChat(openai_api_key="sk-")
agent = OmniModalAgent(llm)
response = agent.run("Create an video of a swarm of fish concept art, game art")
print(response)
```

**ii. Dive into a Conversation**:

**5. Error Handling: Because Bumps on the Road are Inevitable**

Errors are like rain, unpredictable but inevitable. Luckily, OmniModalAgent comes with an umbrella. If there's a hiccup during message processing, itâ€™s gracious enough to let you know.

For instance, if there's a bump, youâ€™ll receive:

```python
Error processing message: [Details of the error]
```

**6. Dive Deeper: Advanced Features and Usage**

The power of OmniModalAgent isnâ€™t just limited to basic interactions. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek into its advanced capabilities:

**Streaming Responses**:

Imagine receiving responses as a gentle stream rather than a sudden splash. With the `_stream_response` method, you can achieve just that.

```python
for token in agent._stream_response(response):
    print(token)
```

**The Treasure Chest: Tools**:

OmniModalAgent boasts a plethora of tools, from image captioning to speech-to-text. When you initialize the agent, it equips itself with these tools, ready to tackle any challenge you throw its way.
